This project represents my bachelor thesis in which I developed a server-client application in C++ that communicates through gRPC to improve the security features of a TP-Link router. 
The project uses proto files, to define messages and services for sending data between the server and client. This setup allows my program to interact with the routerâ€™s API and add extra security features that are not part of the router's standard options. 

The main goal was to make the router more secure by automatically blocking unknown devices from connecting to the network. While the router had a basic blacklist feature that only blocks specific devices, my project introduces a "default block" system. With this new feature, all new devices are blocked by default, and only known devices are allowed to connect, creating a safer network environment.
